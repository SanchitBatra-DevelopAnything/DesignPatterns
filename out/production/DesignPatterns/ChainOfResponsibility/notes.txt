Say we get a request and we need to process it

request --> responsiblity1 ---> responsiblity2 ----> responsiblity3 -->.... -> ProcessingPart

aage karte hain request and its state

say , req came

request aayi --> Check Authentication ---> Check authorization ---> Check Plan info ---> Process accordingly

you can also skip a responsiblity if you want very easily

Example :
Payment process karo
bank can process if amount<500
credit card can process if amount<1000
paypal can process if amt < 1500

req --> bank (process complete OR forward to next responsiblity) --> Credit card ...
------
therefore request Handler will be an abstract class (cuz we have diffrent concrete types) , with next pointer as i/p object.
