Behavioural Pattern

Isme yaar jab bhi tum abstraction kar rahe ho
concrete me implementation ki alag alag algorithms ko strategy banaake import karlo

Example :
Route navigation on vehicles

car ke liye you choose Highway&Road Strategy
bike ke liye you choose thinRoadStrategy
..
...
....
.....

kal ko public transport aagaya , to Code reuse karlo as yhan bhi to tumko Highway&Road strategy hi chahiye
therefore code reusable bna + less prone to errors and more consistent.

Ye to har baar abstraction me lagaa hi dena in interviews.

Ek context ki madad se strategy execute hogi , context will take in a strategy and run that strategy..

---------------
Implementation

For each strategy , there will be a method to do work
therefore strategy interface banaake , alag alag concrete strategies banaalo using your algo
See the example of a calculator.
