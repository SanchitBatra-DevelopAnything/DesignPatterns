Protoype design pattern is used when object creation is heavy and we need to create objects..
What we do is we define base objects at start of application , and clone the already created objects (PROTOTYPES)

After cloning , we modify the properties as and what we need.. to create our object..

CLONABLE INTERFACE implement krna chahiye for its clone to be possible.

Prototypes are stored in registry.

Child classes like 2wheeler and 4 wheeler should also support the clone method.


NOTE : Vehicle ne clonable implement karliya , therefore all child classes bhi clonable hogayin apne aap.
