Structural Design Pattern-2
Bridge design pattern is used when your classes are growing exponentially and all these classes have similar work to do.

Like ,
you have video abstract class
and child classes as ,
youtubeNormal , youtube4K , youtubeHD , youtubeHDR and so on..
and now you add netflix

so netflix ki bhi 10 classes banengi.. :/

BRIDGE DESIGN PATTERN COMES INTO PICTURE :
Deciding factor for new classes is videoProcessor

therefore make videoProcessor as diffrent hierarchy , and convert is-a relation to has-a relationship (BRIDGE)

Each video was a 4k video
now each video has a 4k processor.. aise convert karlo.
