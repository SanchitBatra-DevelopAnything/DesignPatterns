Hides complexity from the client.
Facade is a layer of abstraction which takes input from the user and does all the complex stuff on its own.

We as a user only place order to zomatoFacade
zomatoFacade contacts the restaurant , gets a delivery boy , picks and delivers the order to us..

we just need to tell facade,ok place my order.
